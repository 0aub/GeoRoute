# GeoRoute Centralized Configuration
# All settings are managed from this single file

# Route Generation Method
route_generation:
  # Method: "gemini_image" - Gemini 3 Pro Image draws routes directly on satellite imagery
  method: "gemini_image"
  # Number of routes to generate (2 = better quality, 3 = more options)
  num_routes: 2

# Gemini AI Models
gemini:
  image_model: "gemini-2.0-flash-exp"  # For drawing routes on satellite images (supports image output)
  text_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"       # For analysis and reports

# Route Generation Prompt
route_prompt: |
  Edit this satellite image. Draw exactly 2 route lines from BLUE dot to RED dot.

  ORANGE LINE (Route A):
  - Take the main road, most direct path
  - Single line, no branches

  GREEN LINE (Route B):
  - Take a different, longer path
  - Go around the other side of buildings
  - Single line, no branches

  CRITICAL: Each route is ONE line only. Like tracing with your finger from blue to red.
  Do not draw loops, branches, or multiple paths for either color.
  
    
# Tactical Analysis Prompt (for advanced analytics)
analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze this tactical situation satellite image showing infantry approach routes.

  Context:
  - Friendly forces: {num_soldiers} units (at blue marker)
  - Enemy position: {num_enemies} units (at red marker)
  - Two routes shown: ORANGE (balanced), GREEN (stealth/safest)

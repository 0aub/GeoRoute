# GeoRoute Centralized Configuration
# All settings are managed from this single file

# Route Generation Method
route_generation:
  # Method: "gemini_image" - Gemini 3 Pro Image draws routes directly on satellite imagery
  method: "gemini_image"
  # Number of routes to generate (2 = better quality, 3 = more options)
  num_routes: 2

# Gemini AI Models
gemini:
  image_model: "gemini-3-pro-image-preview"  # For drawing routes on satellite images (Nano Banana Pro)
  text_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"   # For analysis and reports

# Route Generation Prompt
route_prompt: |
  Edit this satellite image. Draw exactly 2 infantry foot patrol routes from BLUE marker to RED marker.

  DRAWING RULES:
  - Draw smooth, curved lines that follow natural walking paths
  - NEVER cross through buildings - always go AROUND them
  - Follow roads, sidewalks, alleys, and open ground
  - Lines should curve naturally like a person walking, not straight angular segments
  - Use cover: stay close to walls, trees, and shadows where possible

  ORANGE LINE (Primary Route):
  - Most direct path while avoiding obstacles
  - Prefer main roads and open paths
  - Single continuous curved line from blue to red

  GREEN LINE (Stealth Route):
  - Longer, more concealed path
  - Use back alleys, building shadows, vegetation
  - Avoid open areas, stay near cover
  - Single continuous curved line from blue to red

  CRITICAL:
  - Routes must NEVER pass through any building or structure
  - Draw natural curved paths, not straight lines or sharp angles
  - Each route is ONE continuous line only - no branches or loops
  
    
# Tactical Analysis Prompt (for advanced analytics)
analysis_prompt: |
  Analyze this tactical situation satellite image showing infantry approach routes.

  Context:
  - Friendly forces: {num_soldiers} units (at blue marker)
  - Enemy position: {num_enemies} units (at red marker)
  - Two routes shown: ORANGE (balanced), GREEN (stealth/safest)
